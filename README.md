"# gingers-blog-backend"

This is the backend for my blogs, I am currently still working on implimenting my photos. I have my models listed for my post and users, I also have the routes defined for each auth, posts, users.

Users will have the ability to create their own profiles and add their own posts to my blog. Then I implimented a possibilty to filter posts per user. Users will also have the ability to update their profiles and blogs.
