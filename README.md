First welcome to The Life of a Ginger... this is where I can share ideas with other people without the restriction of "free speech" or whatever their calling the censorship these days.

For the instructiors looking at my application, please visit https://gingers-blog.herokuapp.com/register this link is not on the navigation bar due to me not wanting others to register but wanted the ability to register others if needed down the road. For testing purposes please use these credentials when registering.

once you have registered you can login and access the posts section where you can select a photo and post it along with your blog, I have also implimented an edit function which allows the post to be edited by the original poster. You can also add and edit your profile setting by clicking on the photo button in the top right section of the page. From there you have to imput all your information and select your profile picture you would like to be displayed. Please refrain from createing a lot of profiles and post as I intend to fully use this application to push my thoughts out there and share my ideas.

In the database you will see a catagory section along with on the sidebar on the desktop version. I am planning on implimenting the ability to filter with categories later on.
